# Queries Directory

This directory contains Neo4j Cypher queries intended for manual database changes, data inspection, and analysis. These queries can be used to make one-off updates, verify data integrity, and generate insights for reporting. As the project evolves, this collection will grow and be used for ongoing database analysis and reporting.
